  <p>For products that are shipped using the services of our courier partners, the date of delivery is an estimate. Your order may be delivered prior or after the chosen date of delivery.</p>

  <p>You acknowledge that requested delivery date is non-binding. Estimated delivery date depends on the availability of the product and the destination to which you want the product to be shipped.</p>

  <p>Our courier partners do not call prior to delivering an order, so we recommend that you provide an address at which someone will be present to receive the package. The delivery cannot be redirected to any other address.</p>

  <p>Courier partners sometimes have some delays due to holidays and strikes.</p>

  <p>In case if the recipient is unavailable, we will attempt delivery twice and in case delivery location is incorrect or the recipient refuses to take the delivery, the delivery shall be deemed to have been made. The courier company will attempt to deliver the package twice before the parcel returns back to the point of origin.</p>

  <p>We will consider the order executed in the below cases:</p>

      Wrong shipping/delivery address.
